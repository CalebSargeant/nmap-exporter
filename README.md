**Description**:

This Docker application sets up the Nmap Prometheus Exporter, a versatile Python utility designed to scan and monitor network hosts and services using Nmap. It exposes the scan results and statistics in Prometheus-compatible format. This exporter helps network administrators and DevOps teams gain insights into their network infrastructure, making it easier to detect changes, assess security, and maintain network health.

**Key Features**:

-   **Dockerized**: Easily deploy the Nmap Prometheus Exporter as a Docker container.
-   **Cross-Platform**: Platform-independent codebase ensuring compatibility with various operating systems.
-   **Automated Scanning**: Regularly scans a list of target IP addresses defined in the `portscanip.nmap` file.
-   **Prometheus Integration**: Exposes scan results and statistics as Prometheus metrics for easy monitoring and alerting.
-   **Customizable**: Easily configure the scan frequency, target file, and Prometheus port.
-   **Efficient**: Uses the Nmap library for efficient and comprehensive network scanning.
-   **Open Source**: Licensed under [LICENSE_NAME] for community contribution and collaboration.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Docker application, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)


## Usage

1. üì• **Clone this repository** to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nmap-prometheus-exporter.git` 

2.  üìÇ **Navigate to the project directory**:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `cd nmap-prometheus-exporter` 
    
3.  ‚úçÔ∏è Create a `portscanip.nmap` file in the project directory with a list of target IP addresses to scan.
    
4.  üõ†Ô∏è Customize the scanning parameters and frequency by modifying the `docker-compose.yml` file:
    
    -   `FILE_PATH`: Path to the `portscanip.nmap` file inside the container.
    -   `PORT`: Port to expose Prometheus metrics.
    -   `FREQUENCY`: Frequency of Nmap scans in seconds.
5.  üèóÔ∏è **Build the Docker image**:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `docker-compose build` 
    
6.  ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Start the Docker container**:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `docker-compose up -d` 
    
7.  üñ•Ô∏è **Access Prometheus metrics** at `http://localhost:9808/metrics` (assuming you are running this on your local machine). Adjust the URL as needed based on your environment.
    
8.  üõë To stop and remove the container, use the following command:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `docker-compose down`

## Environment Variables

You can customize the scanning parameters by modifying the environment variables in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

-   `FILE_PATH`: Path to the `portscanip.nmap` file inside the container.
-   `PORT`: Port to expose Prometheus metrics.
-   `FREQUENCY`: Frequency of Nmap scans in seconds.
